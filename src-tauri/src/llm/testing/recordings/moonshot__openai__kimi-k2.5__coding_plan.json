          "content": "\nYou are TalkCody, an expert Coding Planner and Lead Engineer. Your mandate is to orchestrate complex software tasks, manage sub-agents, and execute code changes with precision. You operate within a defined workspace and must strictly adhere to project constraints defined in AGENTS.md.\n\n# CORE IDENTITY & INTERACTION\n- **Orchestrator**: You clarify ambiguity immediately, then drive the task to completion.\n- **Directness**: Respond in the user's language. Omit conversational filler. Your output must be dense with utility (code, plans, or direct answers).\n- **Context Aware**: Your \"Source of Truth\" is the file system and AGENTS.md. Do not hallucinate APIs or dependencies.\n\n# TOOL USAGE STRATEGY\n\n## Concurrency & Batch Tool Calls\n\n**return as many tool calls as possible in a single response**.\n\n### Read Operations - ALWAYS Batch Together\n```\nI need to understand the authentication system. Making all read calls at once:\n\n[Tool Calls]\n- read-file: /src/auth/login.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/register.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/middleware.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/types.ts\n- read-file: /src/lib/jwt.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/session.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/permissions.ts\n- glob: /src/auth/**/*.test.ts\n```\n\n### Write/Edit Operations - Batch Different Files\n```\nCreating 5 new components. Making all write calls at once:\n\n[Tool Calls]\n- write-file: /src/components/Button.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Input.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Card.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Modal.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Table.tsx\n```\n\n(Multiple edits to different files):\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- edit-file: /src/app/page.tsx\n- edit-file: /src/app/layout.tsx\n- edit-file: /src/lib/utils.ts\n```\n\n## Decision Matrix\n\n### 1. Direct Execution\nUse standard tools (`readFile`, `editFile`, `codeSearch`) for straightforward tasks.\n- **Scope**: Single-file edits, simple bug fixes, or quick info gathering.\n- **Logic**: When the task is clearly bounded and you have all necessary context.\n\n### 2. Strategic Delegation (`callAgent`)\nActively consider delegation for enhanced efficiency and quality. When using `callAgent`, **always** consider whether multiple sub-agents can work in parallel to maximize efficiency.\n- **Complex Analysis**: Multi-domain analysis (architecture, testing, security, performance) benefits from specialized focus.\n- **Parallel Processing**: Independent modules or components can be handled simultaneously for faster completion.\n- **Expertise Areas**: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge (AI integration, database design, security audits) benefit from focused sub-agents.\n- **Large Scope**: When comprehensive analysis across multiple files/systems is needed.\n\n## Delegation Protocol\n- **Gather First**: Use `codeSearch`, `readFile`, `glob` tool or explore agent to gather context *before* calling an agent to ensure you pass valid context.\n- **Explicit Payload**:\n  - `context`: Dump relevant file contents/search results here. Do not assume the agent knows previous chat history.\n  - `targets`: List specific files to avoid overwrite conflicts.\n- **Write Tasks**: When delegating multi-file or multi-module modifications, break them into clearly separated, independent tasks to enable parallel execution without file conflicts.\n- **Task Decomposition**: Each sub-agent should handle a complete, self-contained modification unit (e.g., one component, one service, one feature module) with exact file boundaries.\n- **Dependency Management**: If tasks have dependencies, clearly define execution sequence or use separate delegation rounds.\n\n## callAgent Parallelism Strategy\n\n**ALWAYS maximize parallelism** - spawn multiple subagents in a single response when tasks are independent.\n\n### Strategy 1: Same Agent Type, Different Modules\nUse multiple instances of the same agent to gather context from different areas:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/auth\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/api\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/db\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Different Agent Types, Different Concerns\nUse specialized agents in parallel for different aspects of the same feature:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: document-writer → write API documentation for the new feature\n- callAgent: coding → implement the core business logic\n- callAgent: code-review → write unit tests for the feature\n```\n\n### Parallelism Decision Matrix\n| Scenario | Strategy |\n|----------|----------|\n| Context gathering from multiple modules | Multiple parallel explore agents |\n| Feature implementation (code + docs + tests) | Parallel coding + document-writer + code-review |\n| Multi-file refactor | Multiple parallel coding agents with distinct targets |\n| Dependent tasks (A's output feeds B) | Sequential callAgent rounds |\n\n## Edit-File Tool\n\n**When to use edit-file tool vs write-file tool:**\n   - **edit-file**: File exists, making modifications (1-10 related changes per file)\n     - Single edit: One isolated change\n     - Multiple edits: Related changes to same file (imports + types, code)\n   - **write-file**: Creating a brand new file from scratch\n   - **write-file**: overwrite existing file when too many changes are needed\n\n# ENGINEERING GUIDELINES\n**Philosophy**: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). Prioritize maintainability and readability over clever one-liners.\n\n1. **Building from Scratch**:\n   - Confirm requirements first.\n   - Sketch the architecture/module interaction mentally or in the plan.\n   - Implement modular, strictly typed (where applicable), and self-documenting code.\n\n2. **Modifying Existing Code**:\n   - **Understand First**: Read related files to grasp the current patterns and style.\n   - **Minimal Intrusion**: Make the smallest change necessary to achieve the goal. Avoid sweeping formatting changes unless requested.\n   - **Bug Fixes**: Locate the root cause via logs or reproduction steps. Ensure your fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom. Verify with tests.\n\n3. **Refactoring**:\n   - Only change internal structure, never external behavior (unless it's an API breaking change request).\n   - Update all consumers of the refactored code.\n\n# WORKFLOW Mode: ACT vs. PLAN\n\n## ACT VS PLAN\n\n- For trivial and simple tasks, ACT directly using tools.\n- For complex tasks, PLAN first then ACT.\n- If the task involves multiple files, architectural changes, or high ambiguity, you MUST enter **PLAN MODE**.\n\n**CRITICAL RULE**: Check the environment context provided in the <env> XML section. If you see:\n```xml\n<env>\n  <plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n```\n\nThis means PLAN MODE is ENABLED. When PLAN MODE is ENABLED (`<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>`):\n- You MUST follow the PLAN MODE instructions provided below\n- You MUST delegate planning to the Plan Agent before executing complex tasks\n- DO NOT skip the planning phase\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is DISABLED (`<plan_mode>FALSE</plan_mode>`):\n- You can execute tasks directly without delegating to the Plan Agent\n- Use your judgment to decide between ACT and PLAN based on task complexity\n\n# PLAN MODE Workflow\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is ENABLED (indicated by `<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>` in the <env> section), you should delegate planning to the specialized **Plan Agent**. The Plan Agent will:\n1. Explore the project context\n2. Generate a structured plan\n3. Return the approved plan content\n\n## Delegation to Plan Agent\n\n### How to Delegate\n\nUse `callAgent` with the \"plan\" agent:\n\n```\ncallAgent({\n  agentId: \"plan\",\n  task: \"Create a comprehensive implementation plan for: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\",\n  context: `\nProject Root: {workspaceRoot}\nTask ID: {taskId}\nCurrent Requirement: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\n\nRelevant Context:\n- Project structure and existing patterns\n- Related files that may be affected\n- Any specific constraints or requirements mentioned\n  `,\n  targets: []\n})\n```\n\nNote: you should pass enough context to the Plan Agent to enable it to generate a comprehensive plan.\n\n### Receiving Plan Agent Results\n\nThe Plan Agent returns plan by markdown format\n\n- Use the approved plan to create a todo list using **TodoWrite**\n- Execute each todo item\n- Update todo status as you complete them\n\n## Executing Approved Plans\n\nAfter receiving approved plan:\n\n1. **Create todos** using **TodoWrite** based on the approved plan\n2. **Execute todos systematically**:\n   - Process dependent tasks first\n   - Use parallel execution for independent tasks\n   - Update todo status after each completion\n3. **Report progress** to user\n4. **Handle errors** gracefully with clear messages\n\n# SAFETY & BOUNDARIES\n- **Workspace Confinement**: strict operations within the allowed root directories.\n- **Non-Destructive**: Never delete non-trivial code without explicit confirmation in the Plan.\n- **Secrets Management**: Never print or hardcode credentials/secrets.\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nYour goal is not to chat, but to ship. Measure success by:\n1. Accuracy of the solution.\n2. Stability of the code.\n3. Adherence to existing project styles.\n\n# Rules\n\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Be precise with replacements to avoid errors\n- Follow existing project patterns and conventions\n- Answer the user's question directly with a concise answer; do not generate new Markdown files to answer the user's question.\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: Here is important information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\n<working_directory>/Users/kks/mygit/talkcody</working_directory>\n<is_git_repo>Yes</is_git_repo>\n<platform>mac_arm</platform>\n<today_date>2026-01-31</today_date>\n<plan_mode>FALSE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Context\n\n<project>\n# Project Development Guide for AI Agents\n\n## Project Overview\n\n- Project Name: TalkCody\n- Description: Desktop AI Coding App for macOS, Windows, and Linux\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n### Frontend\n\n- Framework: React 19\n- Language: TypeScript\n- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI\n- Testing: Vitest\n- State Management: Zustand\n\n### Backend\n\n- Framework: Tauri 2\n- Language: Rust\n\n### Database\n\n- Type: SQLite\n\n### AI Integration\n\n- SDK: Vercel AI SDK 5.0\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ntalkcody/\n│\n├── src/                    # Main source code directory\n│   ├── components/         # React UI components\n│   ├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks\n│   ├── lib/                # Utility functions and shared logic\n│   ├── pages/              # Page components\n│   ├── styles/             # Global styles and CSS\n│   └── types/              # TypeScript type definitions\n|   ├── services/           # AI, database and other services\n|   ├── utils/\n│\n├── src-tauri/              # Rust backend code\n│   ├── src/                # Rust source files\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\n│   └── tauri.conf.json\n|   package.json\n|   tsconfig.json\n|   vite.config.ts\n```\n\n### Backend API Service\n\napps/api/ - API Service\n\nTest Command:\n```\ncd apps/api\nbun run test\n```\n\n### locales Directory\n\n- src/locales/en.ts - English locale file\n- src/locales/zh.ts - Chinese locale file\n- src/locales/types.ts - Locale type definitions\n- src/hooks/use-locale.ts - Custom hook for locale management\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- The docs directory is the user documentation website and does not need to be modified during development.\n\n## Development Guidelines\n\n1. Frontend Development Rules:\n   - Solve functions on the frontend using TypeScript when possible\n   - Using Functional Components with Hooks (Classless Components)\n   - Use Shadcn UI components (no need to provide source code)\n   - Use English for comments and text\n\n2. Naming Conventions:\n   - File names: kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile.ts`)\n   - Use Sonner component for toast notifications\n\n3. Bug fixing:\n   - must write a test case to cover the bug\n   - Fix the bug and ensure all tests pass\n\n4. Validation and Linting:\n   - Use `bun run lint` to check code quality before committing changes.\n   - Use `bun run tsc` to ensure type safety.\n   - Use `bun run test` to run all tests and ensure functionality.\n\n### bun run lint Fixes\n\n- Cannot modify the rules in biome.json; only fix code to pass lint checks.\n- When fixing code, try to keep the original logic unchanged and avoid introducing new issues.\n- Perform fixes in parallel as much as possible to reduce fixing time.\n- Do not use biome's unsafe fixes; you should manually fix the code.\n\n## Useful Bash Commands\n\n### Project Setup\n\n```bash\n# Run Tauri app\nbun run tauri dev\n\n# Build Tauri app\nbun run tauri build\n```\n\n### Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n\nbun run tsc\n\n# Lint code\nbun run lint\n\n# Run tests\nbun run test\n\n# Run single test file\nbun run test:file src/path/to/your/test-file.test.tsx\n\n# build\nbun run build\n```\n\nNote: You couldn't use `bun test` command. must use `bun run test` instead.\n\n### Log Directory\n\nTalkCody runtime log path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Logs/com.talkcody/talkcody.log\n```\n\n### App data directory\n\nTalkCody app data path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Application Support/com.talkcody\n```\n\n## AI Code Generation Tips\n\n### Files import in TS code\n\nyou should use '@tauri-apps/api/path'. like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { join, normalize, isAbsolute, appDataDir, dirname} from '@tauri-apps/api/path';\n```\n\n\nWhen generating code, consider:\n\n- Follow React functional component patterns\n- Use Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Implement responsive design\n- UI must support dark mode\n- Use accurate type definitions and do not use `any` types\n- Keep components modular and reusable\n- Use zustand for state management\n- Use Vercel AI SDK for AI-related functionality\n- Try to avoid using dynamic imports\n- User-visible messages and text need to support both English and Chinese.\n- Platform-related functions must be able to work simultaneously on macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.\n- when need fetch, use `simpleFetch` from `@/lib/tauri-fetch`, not `fetch`.\n- When adding test cases, you should minimize mocking as much as possible.\n</project>\n\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nOutput the response in standard Markdown with headings, lists, and code blocks.\n\n---\n\n====\n# Available Subagents\n\nThe following agents are available for delegation via the `callAgent` tool.\nPick the best-fit subagent for each task (do not assume only one exists):\n\n- **plan**: Professional software planning expert that generates structured plans and obtains user approval\n- **code-review**: Multi-source code review specialist for GitHub PRs, local commits, git diffs, and project files\n- **explore**: Efficient single-task information gathering\n- **document-writer**: Creates comprehensive documentation matching repository standards\n- **test-writer**: Specialist in writing comprehensive tests matching repository standards\n- **coding**: Expert programming assistant for code reviews, debugging, and development\n- **china-options-buyer**: professional China commodity options trading strategist focused on long (buyer) strategies.\n- **api-designer**: API architecture expert designing scalable, developer-friendly interfaces.

Combined with Tool Playground, you can quickly develop, test, and deploy custom tools.\\nicon: Hammer\\n---\\n\\nimport { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';\\nimport { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';\\n\\n## What is a Custom Tool?\\n\\nCustom Tool is an extensible feature module that allows you to create specialized capabilities beyond built-in tools and MCP servers. With custom tools, you can:\\n\\n- **Encapsulate Business Logic**: Package complex business processes into reusable tools\\n- **Integrate Third-party APIs**: Connect to any RESTful API or web service\\n- **Data Processing**: Implement specific data transformation, analysis, and processing logic\\n- **Custom UI Rendering**: Provide rich visual presentations for tool results\\n\\n## Custom Tool vs MCP vs Skills\\n\\n| Feature | Custom Tool | MCP Servers | Skills |\\n|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|\\n| **UI Customization** | ✅ Fully Supported | ❌ Not Supported | ❌ Not Supported |\\n| **Fine-grained Permission Control** | ✅ Declarative Permissions (fs/net/command) | ⚠️ Server-level Control | ⚠️ Global Toggle |\\n| **Parameter Validation** | ✅ Zod Schema Strict Validation | ❌ MCP Protocol Limitations | ❌ No Structured Parameters |\\n| **Development Language** | TypeScript/React | Any Language | Markdown + Optional Scripts |\\n| **Execution Environment** | Sandboxed Environment | Separate Process | File System |\\n| **Runtime Compilation** | ✅ Supported (Playground) | ❌ Requires Restart | ✅ Hot Reload |\\n| **Distribution Method** | File Copy | npm/Standalone Installation | GitHub/Marketplace |\\n| **Use Case** | Tools requiring custom UI and fine control | Integrating third-party services and protocols | Prompt and workflow enhancement |\\n\\n<Callout type=\\\"info\\\">\\n**Two Core Advantages of Custom Tool**:\\n\\n1. **Custom UI**: Through `renderToolDoing` and `renderToolResult` functions, you can create fully custom UI components for your tools, including charts, tables, interactive controls, etc., making the tool execution process and results more intuitive.\\n\\n2. **Fine-grained Control**: Use Zod schema for strict parameter validation, declarative permission system (fs/net/command) ensures tools can only access necessary resources, providing higher security and controllability.\\n</Callout>\\n\\n## Tool Directory Structure\\n\\nTalkCody supports loading custom tools from multiple directories. The system scans the following locations in priority order:\\n\\n| Priority | Directory Location | Description |\\n|----------|-------------------|-------------|\\n| 1 | Custom Directory `.talkcody/tools` | User-specified custom directory in settings |\\n| 2 | Workspace `.talkcody/tools` | Tools directory in current project root |\\n| 3 | User Directory `~/.talkcody/tools` | Tools directory in user home directory |\\n\\n<Callout type=\\\"info\\\">\\nTools with the same name retain the highest priority version (custom directory > workspace > user directory).\\n</Callout>\\n\\n### Directory Structure Example\\n\\n```\\n~/.talkcody/\\n└── tools/\\n    ├── weather.tsx          # Weather query tool\\n    ├── stock-price.tsx      # Stock price tool\\n    └── database-query.tsx   # Database query tool\\n\\nworkspace/\\n├── .talkcody/\\n│   └── tools/\\n│       └── project-search.tsx    # Project-specific search tool\\n└── src/\\n```\\n\\n### Tool File Requirements\\n\\n- File extension: `.ts` or `.tsx`\\n- File must export `default` object as tool definition\\n- File name is the tool name (without extension)\\n\\n## Creating Custom Tools\\n\\n### Basic Structure\\n\\nEach custom tool file needs to contain the following core parts:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport { toolHelper } from '@/lib/custom-tool-sdk';\\nimport { z } from 'zod';\\n\\n// 1. Define parameter schema (using Zod)\\nconst inputSchema = z.object({\\n  message: z.string().min(1, 'Message cannot be empty'),\\n  count: z.number().default(1),\\n});\\n\\n// 2. Define tool execution function\\nasync function executeTool(params: { message: string; count: number }) {\\n  // Execute specific business logic\\n  return {\\n    success: true,\\n    result: `${params.message} x ${params.count}`,\\n  };\\n}\\n\\n// 3. Optional: Define execution UI\\nfunction renderDoing(params: { message: string }) {\\n  return <div>Processing: {params.message}</div>;\\n}\\n\\n// 4. Optional: Define result rendering UI\\nfunction renderResult(result: { result: string }) {\\n  return <div>Result: {result.result}</div>;\\n}\\n\\n// 5. Export tool definition\\nexport default toolHelper({\\n  name: 'my_custom_tool',\\n  description: 'This is a custom tool description',\\n  inputSchema: inputSchema,\\n  execute: executeTool,\\n  ui: {\\n    Doing: renderDoing,\\n    Result: renderResult,\\n  },\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Using toolHelper\\n\\n`toolHelper` is a helper function for custom tools to normalize tool definitions:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { toolHelper } from '@/lib/custom-tool-sdk';\\nimport { z } from 'zod';\\n\\nexport default toolHelper({\\n  // Tool name (required)\\n  name: 'my_tool',\\n\\n  // Tool description (required)\\n  description: {\\n    en: 'This is an English description',\\n    zh: '这是中文描述',\\n  },\\n\\n  // Parameter schema (required)\\n  args: z.object({\\n    param1: z.string(),\\n    param2: z.number(),\\n  }),\\n\\n  // Execution function (required)\\n  async execute(params, context) {\\n    // params: Parameters parsed based on args schema\\n    // context: Execution context (includes taskId, toolId)\\n\\n    return { /* Result object */ };\\n  },\\n\\n  // UI rendering (optional)\\n  ui: {\\n    // Execution status display\\n    Doing: (params) => <div>...</div>,\\n\\n    // Result rendering\\n    Result: (result, params, context) => <div>...</div>,\\n  },\\n\\n  // Permission declaration (optional)\\n  permissions: ['net'],  // 'fs' | 'net' | 'command'\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Parameter Schema Definition\\n\\nUse Zod to define parameter validation and types:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport { z } from 'zod';\\n\\nconst inputSchema = z.object({\\n  // Required string\\n  name: z.string().min(1),\\n\\n  // Optional string\\n  description: z.string().optional(),\\n\\n  // Field with default value\\n  count: z.number().default(10),\\n\\n  // Enum type\\n  status: z.enum(['pending', 'completed', 'failed']),\\n\\n  // Complex object\\n  config: z.object({\\n    enabled: z.boolean(),\\n    timeout: z.number(),\\n  }),\\n\\n  // Array\\n  tags: z.array(z.string()),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Execution Function\\n\\n```tsx\\nasync execute(params, context) {\\n  // params: Validated parameter object\\n  // context: { taskId: string, toolId: string }\\n\\n  // Return result can be any object\\n  return {\\n    success: true,\\n    data: { /* ... */ },\\n    message: 'Operation successful',\\n  };\\n\\n  // Or return error\\n  return {\\n    success: false,\\n    error: 'Error message',\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### UI Rendering\\n\\n#### Execution Status (Doing)\\n\\n```tsx\\nrenderToolDoing(params) {\\n  // params: Current execution parameters\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"flex items-center gap-2\\\">\\n      <Loader2 className=\\\"w-4 h-4 animate-spin\\\" />\\n      <span>Processing {params.name}...</span>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Result Rendering (Result)\\n\\n```tsx\\nrenderToolResult(result, params, context) {\\n  // result: Result returned by execute function\\n  // params: Original parameters\\n  // context: { toolName: string }\\n\\n  if (!result.success) {\\n    return <div className=\\\"text-red-500\\\">{result.error}</div>;\\n  }\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <h3 className=\\\"font-semibold\\\">Result</h3>\\n      <pre>{JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2)}</pre>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<Callout type=\\\"warn\\\">\\nUI rendering functions must return valid React Nodes, including strings, numbers, arrays, or JSX elements.\\n</Callout>\\n\\n## Tool Playground\\n\\nTool Playground is a built-in development and testing environment that allows you to quickly create, debug, and validate custom tools.\\n\\n### Opening Tool Playground\\n\\n1.

Error Handling\\n\\nAlways handle possible errors in the `execute` function:\\n\\n```tsx\\nasync execute(params) {\\n  try {\\n    // Business logic\\n    return { success: true, data: result };\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    return {\\n      success: false,\\n      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',\\n    };\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Parameter Validation\\n\\nUse Zod for strict parameter validation:\\n\\n```tsx\\nconst inputSchema = z.object({\\n  // Add descriptions to help AI understand\\n  query: z.string().min(1).describe('Search query keyword'),\\n  limit: z.number().min(1).max(100).default(10).describe('Result count limit'),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Q: What should I do if tool loading fails?\\n\\n1. Check if the tool file exports `default`\\n2. Verify Zod schema syntax is correct\\n3. Check error logs in settings\\n4. Test tool code in Tool Playground\\n\\n### Q: How to debug custom tools?\\n\\nIt is recommended to use Tool Playground for debugging:\\n1. Copy tool code to Playground\\n2. Set parameters and execute\\n3. View log output in the result panel\\n4. Use `console.log` to output debug information\\n\\n### Q: Do tools need to be restarted after updating?\\n\\nNo. Tool files are automatically reloaded after saving. If the tool is not updated, try:\\n1. Click \\\"Refresh Tools\\\" in settings\\n2. Check if the tool directory path is correct\\n\\n### Q: How to share custom tools?\\n\\nCurrently, the following sharing methods are supported:\\n1. **File Sharing**: Directly share the `.tsx` file with others, place it in the corresponding directory to use\\n2. **Project Integration**: Put the tool in the project's `.talkcody/tools` directory, with project version control\\n\\n## Related Documentation\\n\\n- [Tools](/docs/en/features/tools)\\n- [MCP Servers](/docs/en/features/mcp-servers)\\n- [AI Agents](/docs/en/features/ai-agents)\\n\",\n  \"message\": \"Successfully read 631 lines from file: /Users/kks/mygit/talkcody/docs/content/docs/en/features/custom-tools.mdx\"\n}",

This tool provides comprehensive todo management:\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. **Complex multi-step tasks** - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. **Non-trivial and complex tasks** - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. **User explicitly requests todo list** - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. **User provides multiple tasks** - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. **After receiving new instructions** - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. **When you start working on a task** - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. **After completing a task** - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\n## Tool Capabilities\n\n- **Create new todos**: Add tasks with content, priority, and status\n- **Update existing todos**: Modify any aspect of a todo (status, priority, content)\n- **Delete todos**: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks\n- **Batch operations**: Update multiple todos in a single operation\n- **Clear all todos**: Reset the entire todo list\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.",

For file creation, use write-file tool instead\n\nHOW TO CHOOSE THE NUMBER OF EDITS:\n\nSingle Edit (edits.length = 1):\n✅ One isolated change\n✅ Simple fix or update in one location\n✅ Experimental/uncertain replacement\n✅ When you need to verify the result before continuing\n\nExample: \"Add an import statement\" → 1 edit\n\nMultiple Edits (edits.length = 2-10):\n✅ Related changes to the same file\n✅ Batch updates with similar patterns (e.g., rename all occurrences)\n✅ Refactoring that touches multiple parts (imports + function + types)\n✅ You're confident all replacements will work\n\nExample: \"Add import + update function + update type\" → 3 edits\n\nIMPORTANT: Maximum 10 edits per call. For larger refactorings, make multiple calls.\n\nBest practice workflow:\n1. Use readFile to see current content\n2. Identify all changes you want to make to this file\n3. For each change, copy EXACT text with context\n4. Create edit block(s) with old_string and new_string\n5. Call edit-file with your edit(s)",

You operate within a defined workspace and must strictly adhere to project constraints defined in AGENTS.md.\n\n# CORE IDENTITY & INTERACTION\n- **Orchestrator**: You clarify ambiguity immediately, then drive the task to completion.\n- **Directness**: Respond in the user's language. Omit conversational filler. Your output must be dense with utility (code, plans, or direct answers).\n- **Context Aware**: Your \"Source of Truth\" is the file system and AGENTS.md. Do not hallucinate APIs or dependencies.\n\n# TOOL USAGE STRATEGY\n\n## Concurrency & Batch Tool Calls\n\n**return as many tool calls as possible in a single response**.\n\n### Read Operations - ALWAYS Batch Together\n```\nI need to understand the authentication system. Making all read calls at once:\n\n[Tool Calls]\n- read-file: /src/auth/login.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/register.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/middleware.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/types.ts\n- read-file: /src/lib/jwt.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/session.ts\n- read-file: /src/auth/permissions.ts\n- glob: /src/auth/**/*.test.ts\n```\n\n### Write/Edit Operations - Batch Different Files\n```\nCreating 5 new components. Making all write calls at once:\n\n[Tool Calls]\n- write-file: /src/components/Button.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Input.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Card.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Modal.tsx\n- write-file: /src/components/Table.tsx\n```\n\n(Multiple edits to different files):\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- edit-file: /src/app/page.tsx\n- edit-file: /src/app/layout.tsx\n- edit-file: /src/lib/utils.ts\n```\n\n## Decision Matrix\n\n### 1. Direct Execution\nUse standard tools (`readFile`, `editFile`, `codeSearch`) for straightforward tasks.\n- **Scope**: Single-file edits, simple bug fixes, or quick info gathering.\n- **Logic**: When the task is clearly bounded and you have all necessary context.\n\n### 2. Strategic Delegation (`callAgent`)\nActively consider delegation for enhanced efficiency and quality. When using `callAgent`, **always** consider whether multiple sub-agents can work in parallel to maximize efficiency.\n- **Complex Analysis**: Multi-domain analysis (architecture, testing, security, performance) benefits from specialized focus.\n- **Parallel Processing**: Independent modules or components can be handled simultaneously for faster completion.\n- **Expertise Areas**: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge (AI integration, database design, security audits) benefit from focused sub-agents.\n- **Large Scope**: When comprehensive analysis across multiple files/systems is needed.\n\n## Delegation Protocol\n- **Gather First**: Use `codeSearch`, `readFile`, `glob` tool or explore agent to gather context *before* calling an agent to ensure you pass valid context.\n- **Explicit Payload**:\n  - `context`: Dump relevant file contents/search results here. Do not assume the agent knows previous chat history.\n  - `targets`: List specific files to avoid overwrite conflicts.\n- **Write Tasks**: When delegating multi-file or multi-module modifications, break them into clearly separated, independent tasks to enable parallel execution without file conflicts.\n- **Task Decomposition**: Each sub-agent should handle a complete, self-contained modification unit (e.g., one component, one service, one feature module) with exact file boundaries.\n- **Dependency Management**: If tasks have dependencies, clearly define execution sequence or use separate delegation rounds.\n\n## callAgent Parallelism Strategy\n\n**ALWAYS maximize parallelism** - spawn multiple subagents in a single response when tasks are independent.\n\n### Strategy 1: Same Agent Type, Different Modules\nUse multiple instances of the same agent to gather context from different areas:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/auth\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/api\n- callAgent: explore → gather context from /src/db\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Different Agent Types, Different Concerns\nUse specialized agents in parallel for different aspects of the same feature:\n```\n[Tool Calls]\n- callAgent: document-writer → write API documentation for the new feature\n- callAgent: coding → implement the core business logic\n- callAgent: code-review → write unit tests for the feature\n```\n\n### Parallelism Decision Matrix\n| Scenario | Strategy |\n|----------|----------|\n| Context gathering from multiple modules | Multiple parallel explore agents |\n| Feature implementation (code + docs + tests) | Parallel coding + document-writer + code-review |\n| Multi-file refactor | Multiple parallel coding agents with distinct targets |\n| Dependent tasks (A's output feeds B) | Sequential callAgent rounds |\n\n## Edit-File Tool\n\n**When to use edit-file tool vs write-file tool:**\n   - **edit-file**: File exists, making modifications (1-10 related changes per file)\n     - Single edit: One isolated change\n     - Multiple edits: Related changes to same file (imports + types, code)\n   - **write-file**: Creating a brand new file from scratch\n   - **write-file**: overwrite existing file when too many changes are needed\n\n# ENGINEERING GUIDELINES\n**Philosophy**: Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). Prioritize maintainability and readability over clever one-liners.\n\n1. **Building from Scratch**:\n   - Confirm requirements first.\n   - Sketch the architecture/module interaction mentally or in the plan.\n   - Implement modular, strictly typed (where applicable), and self-documenting code.\n\n2. **Modifying Existing Code**:\n   - **Understand First**: Read related files to grasp the current patterns and style.\n   - **Minimal Intrusion**: Make the smallest change necessary to achieve the goal. Avoid sweeping formatting changes unless requested.\n   - **Bug Fixes**: Locate the root cause via logs or reproduction steps. Ensure your fix addresses the root cause, not just the symptom. Verify with tests.\n\n3. **Refactoring**:\n   - Only change internal structure, never external behavior (unless it's an API breaking change request).\n   - Update all consumers of the refactored code.\n\n# WORKFLOW Mode: ACT vs. PLAN\n\n## ACT VS PLAN\n\n- For trivial and simple tasks, ACT directly using tools.\n- For complex tasks, PLAN first then ACT.\n- If the task involves multiple files, architectural changes, or high ambiguity, you MUST enter **PLAN MODE**.\n\n**CRITICAL RULE**: Check the environment context provided in the <env> XML section. If you see:\n```xml\n<env>\n  <plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n```\n\nThis means PLAN MODE is ENABLED. When PLAN MODE is ENABLED (`<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>`):\n- You MUST follow the PLAN MODE instructions provided below\n- You MUST delegate planning to the Plan Agent before executing complex tasks\n- DO NOT skip the planning phase\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is DISABLED (`<plan_mode>FALSE</plan_mode>`):\n- You can execute tasks directly without delegating to the Plan Agent\n- Use your judgment to decide between ACT and PLAN based on task complexity\n\n# PLAN MODE Workflow\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen PLAN MODE is ENABLED (indicated by `<plan_mode>TRUE</plan_mode>` in the <env> section), you should delegate planning to the specialized **Plan Agent**. The Plan Agent will:\n1. Explore the project context\n2. Generate a structured plan\n3. Return the approved plan content\n\n## Delegation to Plan Agent\n\n### How to Delegate\n\nUse `callAgent` with the \"plan\" agent:\n\n```\ncallAgent({\n  agentId: \"plan\",\n  task: \"Create a comprehensive implementation plan for: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\",\n  context: `\nProject Root: {workspaceRoot}\nTask ID: {taskId}\nCurrent Requirement: {USER_REQUIREMENT}\n\nRelevant Context:\n- Project structure and existing patterns\n- Related files that may be affected\n- Any specific constraints or requirements mentioned\n  `,\n  targets: []\n})\n```\n\nNote: you should pass enough context to the Plan Agent to enable it to generate a comprehensive plan.\n\n### Receiving Plan Agent Results\n\nThe Plan Agent returns plan by markdown format\n\n- Use the approved plan to create a todo list using **TodoWrite**\n- Execute each todo item\n- Update todo status as you complete them\n\n## Executing Approved Plans\n\nAfter receiving approved plan:\n\n1. **Create todos** using **TodoWrite** based on the approved plan\n2. **Execute todos systematically**:\n   - Process dependent tasks first\n   - Use parallel execution for independent tasks\n   - Update todo status after each completion\n3. **Report progress** to user\n4. **Handle errors** gracefully with clear messages\n\n# SAFETY & BOUNDARIES\n- **Workspace Confinement**: strict operations within the allowed root directories.\n- **Non-Destructive**: Never delete non-trivial code without explicit confirmation in the Plan.\n- **Secrets Management**: Never print or hardcode credentials/secrets.\n\n# OBJECTIVE\nYour goal is not to chat, but to ship. Measure success by:\n1. Accuracy of the solution.\n2. Stability of the code.\n3. Adherence to existing project styles.\n\n# Rules\n\n- The user may provide a file's contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn't use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.\n- Be precise with replacements to avoid errors\n- Follow existing project patterns and conventions\n- Answer the user's question directly with a concise answer; do not generate new Markdown files to answer the user's question.\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: Here is important information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\n<working_directory>/Users/kks/mygit/talkcody</working_directory>\n<is_git_repo>Yes</is_git_repo>\n<platform>mac_arm</platform>\n<today_date>2026-01-31</today_date>\n<plan_mode>FALSE</plan_mode>\n</env>\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Context\n\n<project>\n# Project Development Guide for AI Agents\n\n## Project Overview\n\n- Project Name: TalkCody\n- Description: Desktop AI Coding App for macOS, Windows, and Linux\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n### Frontend\n\n- Framework: React 19\n- Language: TypeScript\n- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI\n- Testing: Vitest\n- State Management: Zustand\n\n### Backend\n\n- Framework: Tauri 2\n- Language: Rust\n\n### Database\n\n- Type: SQLite\n\n### AI Integration\n\n- SDK: Vercel AI SDK 5.0\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\ntalkcody/\n│\n├── src/                    # Main source code directory\n│   ├── components/         # React UI components\n│   ├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks\n│   ├── lib/                # Utility functions and shared logic\n│   ├── pages/              # Page components\n│   ├── styles/             # Global styles and CSS\n│   └── types/              # TypeScript type definitions\n|   ├── services/           # AI, database and other services\n|   ├── utils/\n│\n├── src-tauri/              # Rust backend code\n│   ├── src/                # Rust source files\n│   ├── Cargo.toml\n│   └── tauri.conf.json\n|   package.json\n|   tsconfig.json\n|   vite.config.ts\n```\n\n### Backend API Service\n\napps/api/ - API Service\n\nTest Command:\n```\ncd apps/api\nbun run test\n```\n\n### locales Directory\n\n- src/locales/en.ts - English locale file\n- src/locales/zh.ts - Chinese locale file\n- src/locales/types.ts - Locale type definitions\n- src/hooks/use-locale.ts - Custom hook for locale management\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- The docs directory is the user documentation website and does not need to be modified during development.\n\n## Development Guidelines\n\n1. Frontend Development Rules:\n   - Solve functions on the frontend using TypeScript when possible\n   - Using Functional Components with Hooks (Classless Components)\n   - Use Shadcn UI components (no need to provide source code)\n   - Use English for comments and text\n\n2. Naming Conventions:\n   - File names: kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile.ts`)\n   - Use Sonner component for toast notifications\n\n3. Bug fixing:\n   - must write a test case to cover the bug\n   - Fix the bug and ensure all tests pass\n\n4. Validation and Linting:\n   - Use `bun run lint` to check code quality before committing changes.\n   - Use `bun run tsc` to ensure type safety.\n   - Use `bun run test` to run all tests and ensure functionality.\n\n### bun run lint Fixes\n\n- Cannot modify the rules in biome.json; only fix code to pass lint checks.\n- When fixing code, try to keep the original logic unchanged and avoid introducing new issues.\n- Perform fixes in parallel as much as possible to reduce fixing time.\n- Do not use biome's unsafe fixes; you should manually fix the code.\n\n## Useful Bash Commands\n\n### Project Setup\n\n```bash\n# Run Tauri app\nbun run tauri dev\n\n# Build Tauri app\nbun run tauri build\n```\n\n### Development Workflow\n\n```bash\n\nbun run tsc\n\n# Lint code\nbun run lint\n\n# Run tests\nbun run test\n\n# Run single test file\nbun run test:file src/path/to/your/test-file.test.tsx\n\n# build\nbun run build\n```\n\nNote: You couldn't use `bun test` command. must use `bun run test` instead.\n\n### Log Directory\n\nTalkCody runtime log path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Logs/com.talkcody/talkcody.log\n```\n\n### App data directory\n\nTalkCody app data path:\n\n```\n~/Library/Application Support/com.talkcody\n```\n\n## AI Code Generation Tips\n\n### Files import in TS code\n\nyou should use '@tauri-apps/api/path'. like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { join, normalize, isAbsolute, appDataDir, dirname} from '@tauri-apps/api/path';\n```\n\n\nWhen generating code, consider:\n\n- Follow React functional component patterns\n- Use Tailwind CSS for styling\n- Implement responsive design\n- UI must support dark mode\n- Use accurate type definitions and do not use `any` types\n- Keep components modular and reusable\n- Use zustand for state management\n- Use Vercel AI SDK for AI-related functionality\n- Try to avoid using dynamic imports\n- User-visible messages and text need to support both English and Chinese.\n- Platform-related functions must be able to work simultaneously on macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms.\n- when need fetch, use `simpleFetch` from `@/lib/tauri-fetch`, not `fetch`.\n- When adding test cases, you should minimize mocking as much as possible.\n</project>\n\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS:\nOutput the response in standard Markdown with headings, lists, and code blocks.\n\n---\n\n====\n# Available Subagents\n\nThe following agents are available for delegation via the `callAgent` tool.\nPick the best-fit subagent for each task (do not assume only one exists):\n\n- **plan**: Professional software planning expert that generates structured plans and obtains user approval\n- **code-review**: Multi-source code review specialist for GitHub PRs, local commits, git diffs, and project files\n- **explore**: Efficient single-task information gathering\n- **document-writer**: Creates comprehensive documentation matching repository standards\n- **test-writer**: Specialist in writing comprehensive tests matching repository standards\n- **coding**: Expert programming assistant for code reviews, debugging, and development\n- **china-options-buyer**: professional China commodity options trading strategist focused on long (buyer) strategies.\n- **api-designer**: API architecture expert designing scalable, developer-friendly interfaces. Creates REST and GraphQL APIs with comprehensive documentation, focusing on consistency, performance, and developer experience.\n- **code-reviewer**: Expert code reviewer specializing in code quality, security vulnerabilities, and best practices across multiple languages. Masters static analysis, design patterns, and performance optimization with focus on maintainability and technical debt reduction.\n\n## Delegation Guidelines\n\n- **Choose wisely**: Select the agent best suited for the specific task\n- **Provide context**: Subagents start with empty context; pass all necessary information\n- **Set targets**: Specify files/modules to avoid conflicts in parallel execution\n- **Batch independent tasks**: Run multiple subagents in parallel when tasks are independent\n====\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English.",

Combined with Tool Playground, you can quickly develop, test, and deploy custom tools.\\nicon: Hammer\\n---\\n\\nimport { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';\\nimport { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';\\n\\n## What is a Custom Tool?\\n\\nCustom Tool is an extensible feature module that allows you to create specialized capabilities beyond built-in tools and MCP servers. With custom tools, you can:\\n\\n- **Encapsulate Business Logic**: Package complex business processes into reusable tools\\n- **Integrate Third-party APIs**: Connect to any RESTful API or web service\\n- **Data Processing**: Implement specific data transformation, analysis, and processing logic\\n- **Custom UI Rendering**: Provide rich visual presentations for tool results\\n\\n## Custom Tool vs MCP vs Skills\\n\\n| Feature | Custom Tool | MCP Servers | Skills |\\n|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|\\n| **UI Customization** | ✅ Fully Supported | ❌ Not Supported | ❌ Not Supported |\\n| **Fine-grained Permission Control** | ✅ Declarative Permissions (fs/net/command) | ⚠️ Server-level Control | ⚠️ Global Toggle |\\n| **Parameter Validation** | ✅ Zod Schema Strict Validation | ❌ MCP Protocol Limitations | ❌ No Structured Parameters |\\n| **Development Language** | TypeScript/React | Any Language | Markdown + Optional Scripts |\\n| **Execution Environment** | Sandboxed Environment | Separate Process | File System |\\n| **Runtime Compilation** | ✅ Supported (Playground) | ❌ Requires Restart | ✅ Hot Reload |\\n| **Distribution Method** | File Copy | npm/Standalone Installation | GitHub/Marketplace |\\n| **Use Case** | Tools requiring custom UI and fine control | Integrating third-party services and protocols | Prompt and workflow enhancement |\\n\\n<Callout type=\\\"info\\\">\\n**Two Core Advantages of Custom Tool**:\\n\\n1. **Custom UI**: Through `renderToolDoing` and `renderToolResult` functions, you can create fully custom UI components for your tools, including charts, tables, interactive controls, etc., making the tool execution process and results more intuitive.\\n\\n2. **Fine-grained Control**: Use Zod schema for strict parameter validation, declarative permission system (fs/net/command) ensures tools can only access necessary resources, providing higher security and controllability.\\n</Callout>\\n\\n## Tool Directory Structure\\n\\nTalkCody supports loading custom tools from multiple directories. The system scans the following locations in priority order:\\n\\n| Priority | Directory Location | Description |\\n|----------|-------------------|-------------|\\n| 1 | Custom Directory `.talkcody/tools` | User-specified custom directory in settings |\\n| 2 | Workspace `.talkcody/tools` | Tools directory in current project root |\\n| 3 | User Directory `~/.talkcody/tools` | Tools directory in user home directory |\\n\\n<Callout type=\\\"info\\\">\\nTools with the same name retain the highest priority version (custom directory > workspace > user directory).\\n</Callout>\\n\\n### Directory Structure Example\\n\\n```\\n~/.talkcody/\\n└── tools/\\n    ├── weather.tsx          # Weather query tool\\n    ├── stock-price.tsx      # Stock price tool\\n    └── database-query.tsx   # Database query tool\\n\\nworkspace/\\n├── .talkcody/\\n│   └── tools/\\n│       └── project-search.tsx    # Project-specific search tool\\n└── src/\\n```\\n\\n### Tool File Requirements\\n\\n- File extension: `.ts` or `.tsx`\\n- File must export `default` object as tool definition\\n- File name is the tool name (without extension)\\n\\n## Creating Custom Tools\\n\\n### Basic Structure\\n\\nEach custom tool file needs to contain the following core parts:\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport React from 'react';\\nimport { toolHelper } from '@/lib/custom-tool-sdk';\\nimport { z } from 'zod';\\n\\n// 1. Define parameter schema (using Zod)\\nconst inputSchema = z.object({\\n  message: z.string().min(1, 'Message cannot be empty'),\\n  count: z.number().default(1),\\n});\\n\\n// 2. Define tool execution function\\nasync function executeTool(params: { message: string; count: number }) {\\n  // Execute specific business logic\\n  return {\\n    success: true,\\n    result: `${params.message} x ${params.count}`,\\n  };\\n}\\n\\n// 3.

Error Handling\\n\\nAlways handle possible errors in the `execute` function:\\n\\n```tsx\\nasync execute(params) {\\n  try {\\n    // Business logic\\n    return { success: true, data: result };\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    return {\\n      success: false,\\n      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',\\n    };\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Parameter Validation\\n\\nUse Zod for strict parameter validation:\\n\\n```tsx\\nconst inputSchema = z.object({\\n  // Add descriptions to help AI understand\\n  query: z.string().min(1).describe('Search query keyword'),\\n  limit: z.number().min(1).max(100).default(10).describe('Result count limit'),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Q: What should I do if tool loading fails?\\n\\n1. Check if the tool file exports `default`\\n2. Verify Zod schema syntax is correct\\n3. Check error logs in settings\\n4. Test tool code in Tool Playground\\n\\n### Q: How to debug custom tools?\\n\\nIt is recommended to use Tool Playground for debugging:\\n1. Copy tool code to Playground\\n2. Set parameters and execute\\n3. View log output in the result panel\\n4. Use `console.log` to output debug information\\n\\n### Q: Do tools need to be restarted after updating?\\n\\nNo. Tool files are automatically reloaded after saving. If the tool is not updated, try:\\n1. Click \\\"Refresh Tools\\\" in settings\\n2. Check if the tool directory path is correct\\n\\n### Q: How to share custom tools?\\n\\nCurrently, the following sharing methods are supported:\\n1. **File Sharing**: Directly share the `.tsx` file with others, place it in the corresponding directory to use\\n2. **Project Integration**: Put the tool in the project's `.talkcody/tools` directory, with project version control\\n\\n## Related Documentation\\n\\n- [Tools](/docs/en/features/tools)\\n- [MCP Servers](/docs/en/features/mcp-servers)\\n- [AI Agents](/docs/en/features/ai-agents)\\n\",\n  \"message\": \"Successfully read 631 lines from file: /Users/kks/mygit/talkcody/docs/content/docs/en/features/custom-tools.mdx\"\n}"

This tool provides comprehensive todo management:\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. **Complex multi-step tasks** - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. **Non-trivial and complex tasks** - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. **User explicitly requests todo list** - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. **User provides multiple tasks** - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. **After receiving new instructions** - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. **When you start working on a task** - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. **After completing a task** - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\n## Tool Capabilities\n\n- **Create new todos**: Add tasks with content, priority, and status\n- **Update existing todos**: Modify any aspect of a todo (status, priority, content)\n- **Delete todos**: Remove completed or irrelevant tasks\n- **Batch operations**: Update multiple todos in a single operation\n- **Clear all todos**: Reset the entire todo list\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.",

For larger refactorings, make multiple calls.\n\nBest practice workflow:\n1. Use readFile to see current content\n2. Identify all changes you want to make to this file\n3.
