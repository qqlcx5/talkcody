3. Use `↑` `↓` arrow keys to navigate results
4. Press `Enter` to open the selected file
5. Press `Esc` to cancel the search

### Features

- **Multi-keyword Search**: Use spaces to separate multiple keywords, matching files that contain all keywords. For example: typing `user auth` will find files containing both "user" and "auth"
- **Line Number Jump**: Supports `filename:line_number` format to jump directly to a specific line. For example: typing `test.cpp:82` will open the file and jump to line 82
- **High Performance**: Uses Rust backend for searching, supports large codebases
